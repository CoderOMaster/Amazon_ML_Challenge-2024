# Amazon ML Challenge: Entity Extraction from Product Images

This repository contains our solution for the Amazon Machine Learning Challenge, which involved building a model to extract entity values from product images. This capability is crucial for e-commerce applications where product specifications, such as weight, dimensions, voltage, etc., are often embedded within images.

## Problem Overview

As digital marketplaces grow, many products lack detailed textual descriptions, which makes it essential to extract key information directly from images. Our task was to create a machine learning model that could effectively extract product entity values such as weight, dimensions, voltage, and more from images. 

The dataset provided consisted of two CSV files: `train.csv` and `test.csv`. The training data included URLs to images, product categories, entity names, and entity values, while the test data contained similar information but without the entity values (which were the target to be predicted).

## Solution Approach

### 1. Text Extraction using PaddleOCR
Given that the dataset was large and text extraction from the images was complex due to overlapping or obscured text, we tested various OCR models. After comparing the results, we settled on **PaddleOCR** as it provided the most accurate text extraction results for our use case.

### 2. Model Selection and Experimentation

We considered several approaches to tackle the problem, including:

- **Fine-tuning LLaMA 3**: Initially, we explored the idea of fine-tuning LLaMA 3 on our training dataset. However, this approach was computationally expensive and time-consuming.
  
- **BERT for Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Next, we tried using BERT to perform NER on the extracted text. While this improved our ability to identify relevant entities, it was not sufficient to achieve the desired results.

- **Multimodal LLMs**: We also experimented with multimodal large language models (LLMs) that combine text and image understanding. However, the performance did not meet our expectations.

### 3. Prompt Tuning with LLaMA 3

In the end, we found that the best approach was to use **prompt-tuning** on LLaMA 3 with a one-shot learning example. By providing LLaMA 3 with a single example of how to extract dimensions, categories, and other attributes from the text, we were able to significantly improve the model's ability to extract the necessary information from the images.

### 4. Data Cleaning

After obtaining the output from the model, we performed data cleaning to ensure that the extracted values matched Amazon's formatting standards. For example:
- We converted "Centimeter" to "cm"
- Standardized "voltage" to "V" and "wattage" to "W"

This data cleaning step was crucial for aligning the model's output with Amazon's criteria.

### 5. Results and Final Thoughts

Although we experimented with different models from **Ollama**, LLaMA 3 proved to be the fastest and most efficient for our task. 

Given that we had mid-semester exams during the competition, we did our best with the time available. While there's always room for improvement, we are satisfied with the solution we provided within the constraints we faced.

## How to Run the Solution

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com//CoderOMaster/Amazon_ML_Challenge-2024
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```

3. Run the solution notebook:
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook file `solution.ipynb` and follow the steps to reproduce the results.
   
4. Ensure you have access to the dataset (train.csv and test.csv), and modify the notebook paths accordingly.

## Conclusion

This project explored various models and techniques to extract entity values from product images, with prompt-tuned LLaMA 3 and PaddleOCR being the key components of our final solution. Despite time constraints, we achieved meaningful results and learned valuable lessons about multimodal learning and data extraction from complex images.
